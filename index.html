  <h2>👋 About Me</h2>
  <p>Heyo! 🙌 My name’s Chaba 🌸, and I’m from Thailand. I was born in 1994 (yeah, I know, I’m getting old 🤦‍♂️). As a kid, I was super into computers 💻 and loved drawing 🎨, but life decided to throw me into hard mode so I didn’t get to study anything I actually liked (sad life 😢).</p>
  <p>But thanks to this era of AI saving the day! 🤖✨ Now I’m finally diving into everything I missed out on—web development 🌐, crypto 💰, pixel art 🟩, and anything else my younger self wanted to do. Life’s way more fun now, trust me! 🚀</p>

  <h2>🎯 About This Project</h2>
  <p>This project started with a random idea 🧠: making a website to randomize colors for pixel art 🎨✨. At first, it was just for fun, but then I thought, "Hey, why not turn it into a platform for creating NFTs 🖼️ or even a playground for hobbies?</p>
  <p>I’m still learning and improving it bit by bit 🛠️. Hopefully, one day it’ll turn into something really awesome! Thanks for stopping by and checking out my little project—cheer me on, okay? 💪😄</p>
